Dominion is a board card game based on building a deck and getting victory points.
You can play it online at [playdominion.com](http://playdominion.com).

This is a learning project. By that I mean I'm willing to learn some technologies like `nodejs` and how to develop things around it. This includes testing(`mocha`, `should`), continuous integration(`travis`, `coveralls`) and also prototypal JavaScript (`selfish`).

Therefore I may never end this project. You should not take this as an example.

# Building

You need `grunt` to launch the different tasks (install with `npm install -g grunt-cli`).

```
npm install
grunt
```

# Tasks

* `deploy`: build with `r.js`
* `test`: launch the tests
* `serve`: launch a local server
* `jshint`: lint js code
* `coverage`: launch the coverage test

# Coding Style

* Indentation: 2 spaces
* Braces: at the end of the line like
```
if (test) {
  do();
}
```
* Protoypes: start with Upper Case. ex: `var cafe = Cafe.new()`
* Globals: add them to the `globals.js` file

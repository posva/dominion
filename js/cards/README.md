Cards
===

Here goes the code for every card.
Common cards like copper and estates appear at root while other cards appear within a folder named after the expansion they belong.
For instance Harem belong to The Intrigue and must be placed in a folder named `the-intrigue`.

The rules for naming are:
* Don't use `'`, just ignore it, the cards have a name attribute
* Replace spaces with `-`
* lower case for every name
